# Welcome To FundGoalDotFun

FundGoalDotFun is a decentralized token launcher that empowers users to tokenize and crowdfund scholarships, research, startups, and creative projects. Featuring gamified milestones, deployer incentives, and peer-to-peer donations, it offers a transparent, secure, and scalable way to raise funds onchain.

2. Problem Statement
Traditional crowdfunding platforms are plagued by:

Centralized gatekeeping
High fees
Lack of transparency
